            	 <div class="respect">
                  <p><b>Respect</b><br>
                 We show respect by speaking and acting with courtesy. We treat others with dignity and honor the rules of our family, school, and nation. Respect yourself, and others will respect you.<br>
                 </div>
                 <div class="honesty">
                 <b>Honesty</b><br>
                 We are honest when we are truthful and sincere. It is important because it builds trust. When people are honest, they can be relied on to not lie, cheat or steal. Being honest means that you accept yourself as you are. When you are open and trustworthy, others can believe in you.<br>
                 </div>
                 <div class="discipline">
                 <b>Self-Discipline</b><br>
                 We show self-discipline when we exercise self-control. It is being who you really are and doing what you really want to do, rather than being tossed around by your feelings like a leaf in the wind. You act, instead of reacting. You get things done in an orderly and efficient way. You are self-directed. With self-discipline, you take charge of yourself.</p>
